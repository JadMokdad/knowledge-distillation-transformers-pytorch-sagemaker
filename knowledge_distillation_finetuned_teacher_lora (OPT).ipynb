        "Welcome to our end-to-end task-specific knowledge distilattion Text-Classification example using Transformers, PyTorch & Amazon SageMaker. Distillation is the process of training a small \"student\" to mimic a larger \"teacher\". In this example, we will use [BERT-base](https://huggingface.co/textattack/bert-base-uncased-SST-2) as Teacher and [BERT-Tiny](https://huggingface.co/google/bert_uncased_L-2_H-128_A-2) as Student. We will use [Text-Classification](https://huggingface.co/tasks/text-classification) as task-specific knowledge distillation task and the [Stanford Sentiment Treebank v2 (SST-2)](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/sst) dataset for training.\n",

        "In Task-specific knowledge distillation a \"second step of distillation\" is used to \"fine-tune\" the model on a given dataset. This idea comes from the [DistilBERT paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01108.pdf) where it was shown that a student performed better than simply finetuning the distilled language model:\n",
        "\n",
        "> We also studied whether we could add another step of distillation during the adaptation phase by fine-tuning DistilBERT on SQuAD using a BERT model previously fine-tuned on SQuAD as a teacher for an additional term in the loss (knowledge distillation). In this setting, there are thus two successive steps of distillation, one during the pre-training phase and one during the adaptation phase. In this case, we were able to reach interesting performances given the size of the model:79.8 F1 and 70.4 EM, i.e. within 3 points of the full model.\n",

For the example i created a script deriving this notebook to make it as easy as possible to use for you.
